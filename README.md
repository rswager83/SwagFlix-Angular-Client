## Description:

SwagFlix is a movie display application built using Angular and the SwagFlix REST API created for the SwagFlix-Client project.

## Key Features:

  - A button that when clicked, takes a user to the director view. This view will share details about the director of that particular movie.
  - A button that when clicked, takes a user to the genre view. This view will share details about that genre of the movie.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
